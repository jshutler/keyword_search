BOTH DATED\nOCTOBER 25 AND MAY HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN IO\/LABW BY THIS TIME.\n\n2.

PAPER BS\/1\/2 STATES THAT FUNDS PRESENTLY ALLOCATED IN 1974-75\nBUDGET FOR BUILDING WILL NOT RPT NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR PAYING\nCONTRACTORS BILLS FALLING DUE IN 1975. SOME OF THESE BILLS\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nPAGE 02  GENEVA 06731  051631Z\n\nWILL BE FOR EXTRA WORK CONTRACTED FOR SO THAT MOVE INTO NEW\nBUILDING CAN BE SUFFICIENTLY ACCOMPLISHED TO ENABLE GOVERNING\nBODY TO MEET THERE IN FEBRUARY 1975. THERE ARE ALSO SOME THREE\nMILLION FRANCS IN BILLS THAT OFFICE IS PROTESTING AND THAT\nPOSSIBLY WILL GO TO ARBITRATION. OFFICE MUST BE PREPARED FOR\nDECISION AWARDING PART OR ALL OF CONTESTED OVERRUNS TO CONTRACTORS.\n\n4. TO PROVIDE CASH NEEDED FOR PAYMENT OF 1975 BILLS, AND TO\nPROVIDE READILY ACCESSIBLE FUNDS FOR FUTURE ALTERATIONS, REPAIS,\nAND MAINTENANCE, DIRECTOR GENERAL PROPOSES FOLLOWING MEASURES;\n  A. ANNUAL PAYMENTS OF THE 40 YEAR FIPOI MORTAGE ARE SET AT\n5,652,400 FRANCS. FIPOI INFORMALLY AGREES TO ACCEPT THE FIRST\nPAYMENY (1975) AN AMOUNT OF THREE MILLION FRANCS, WITH REMAINING\n2,652,400 BEING SPREAD EQUALLY OVER REMAINING THIRTY-NINE PAY-\nMENTS. DIRECTOR GENERAL PROPOSES TO TRANSFER THE 2,652,400 FRANCS,\nALREADY PROVIDED IN 1975-75 BUDGET, TO BUILDING AND ACCOMMODATION\nFUND.\n  B. NET RECEIPTS FROM RENTALS IN FUTURE WILL BE PAID TO\nBUILDING AND ACCOMMODATION FUND. SOURCES WILL BE RENT FROM\nCONCESSIONAIRS (BANK,BOOK, STALL, TRAVEL AGENCY, FOOD SERVICES)\nAND OTHER AGENCIES RENTING OFFICE SPACE IN NEW BUILDING. (THERE\nIS NO RPT NO DECISION YET ON PRINCIPLE OF PARKING FEE, OR WHERE\nMONEY WOULD GO IF FEE CHARGED.)\n  C. PROGRAM, FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE (PFA) WILL\nBE ASKED (SEE DOCUMENT GB. 194\/PFA\/13\/19, PARAS 7 AND 12) TO\nAUTHORIZE DIRECTOR GENERAL TO DRAW ON BUILDING AND ACCOMMODATION\nFUND TO MEET SUCH EXPENDITURES AS MAY BE NECESSARY ABOVE THE\n140,600,000 FRANCS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. ACCORDING TO JOHN\nRICHES, ILO BUILDING COORDINATOR, THESE ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE USED\nTO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTORS IN 1975, AND TO ENABLE DIRECTOR\nGENERAL TO CARRY OUT FUTURE ALTERNATIONS, REPAIRS AND MAINTENCE.\n\n5. USDEL AND SOVDEL PROTESTED LATE PRESENTATION OF DOCUMENTS,\nAND STATED THEY WERE UNABLE TO TAKE ANY POSITION ON DIRECTOR\nGENERAL'S REQUESTS UNTIL THEY HAD INSTURCTIONS, WHICH THEY WOULD\nSEEK ASAP. CHAIRMAN (MORGAN, UK) AGREED THAT SUBCOMMITTEE COULD\nBE RECONVENED WHEN USDEL AND SOVDEL HAVE INSTRUCTIONS. PRESUME\nTHIS WILL HAVE TO BE BY MONDAY, NOV 11 AT LATES, SINCE PLENARY\nSESSIONS START NOV 12.\n\n6. USDEL SEES SOME MERIT IN SUPPORTING ALL PROPOSALS, SINCE\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nUNCLASSIFIED\n\nPAGE 03  GENEVA 06731  051631Z\n\nTHEY WOULD HAVE EFFECT OF REDUCING CLAIRMS OF NEW BUILDING\nAGAINST ASSESSMENT BUDGET, WHICH ARE GOING TO BE EMBARRASSINGLY\nLARGE AT BEST. ALSO, IN CASE OF GENUINE EMERGENCY, PROPOSED\nARRANGEMENTS WOULD GIVE DIRECTOR GENERAL MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY\nIN ACTING EXPEDITIOUSLY TO CONTRACT FOR REPAIRS. USDEL NOT\nINCLINED RECOMMEND SUPPORT, HOWEVER FOR FOLLOWING REASONS:\n  A. WITH PROPOSAL TO DIVERT ONE-HALF OF NET RECEIPTS FROM\nPUBLICATION SALES AWAY FROM WORKING CAPITAL FUND (WCF), WHICH\nPROBABLY WILL BE APPROVED, PROPOSED DIVERSION OF RENTALS THAT\nWOULD OTHERWISE GO TO WCF, COULD RESULT IN LOWING OF WCF\nTO POINT OF REQUIRING A REPLENISHMENT ASSESSMENT ON ILO MEMBERS.\n  B. DIRECTOR GENERAL WILL ACQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL SUMS (RENTAL\nRECEIPTS ESTIMATED AT 490,000 FRANCS A YEAR) WHICH HE CAN USE\nWITHOUT GOVERNING BODY APPROVAL.\n\n7 . USDEL REQUESTS INSTRUCTIONS ONFOLLOWING POINTS:\nA. PRPOSAL TO DIVERT 2,652,400 FRANCS FROM FIRST (1975)\nMORTAGE PAYMENT INTO BUILDING AND ACCOMMODATION FUND, FOR\nPURPOSE OF PAYING 1975 BUILDING BILLS.\n  B.

PROPOSAL THAT FUTURE RETNTALS BE PAID INTO BUILDING AND\nACCOMMODATION FUND, INSTEAD OF INTO WCF.\n  D.

MEETING MAF (PROBABLY\nWITH FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER KUZNETSOV) IS ALSO A\nPOSSIBILITY.  IF SENATOR HAS CHANGES TO SUGGEST, WE RECOMMEND\nTHAT DEPARTMENT CABLE THEM TO US IMMEDIATE.  IDEALLY THEY\nSHOULD ARRIVE BEFORE COB MOSCOW TIME NOVEMBER 6 AS SOVIET\nOFFICES WILL BE CLOSED NOVEMBER 7, 8, AND 9.

IF SENATOR WOULD LIKE TO MEET BUSINESSMEN\nMONDAY, NOVEMBER 11, HOWEVER (BEFORE LEAVING FOR LENINGRAD),\nIT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW BEFORE HOLIDAY PERIOD BEGINS\nHERE.\n\n4.  U.S. EXCHANGE STUDENTS VERY EAGER TO MEET SENATOR.

AMBASSADOR STOESSEL WOULD LIKE TO HOST A LUNCH FOR\nSENATOR WHICH WOULD INVOLVE HIS SOVIET HOSTS AND OTHER SOVIET\nGUESTS.  ASSUMING NO MAJOR CHANGES IN SENATOR'S SCHEDULE, BEST\nTIME WOULD PROBABLY BE SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16, AT 1300.\n\n6.  MFA ADVISES US THAT JOURNALISTS TRAVELLING FROM U.S.\nWITH SENATOR SHOULD MAKE HOTEL AND TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS\nTHROUGH INTOURIST.  USA DIVISION HAS PROMISED TO BE\nHELPFUL IF JOURNALISTS HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH RESERVATIONS,\nBUT IT HAS MADE CLEAR THAT SOVIETS DO NOT REGARD\nJOURNALISTS AS GUESTS OF SUPREME SOVIET OR MEMBERS OF\nOFFICIAL IARTY.

EMBASSY HAS RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEWS OF SENATOR\nBY MOSCOW RADIO AND TASS.  IF SENATOR IS AGREEABLE TO\nINTERVIEWS, DETAILS CAN BE WORKED OUT WHEN HE ARRIVES.\n\n8.  SENATOR AND PARTY WILL BE STAYING AT HOTEL SOVYETSKAYA,\nTHE GUEST HOTEL OF THE USSR COUNCIL OF MINISTERS.\nACCORDING TO USA DIVISION, ACCOMPANYING PRESS WILL\nPROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO STAY AT SOVYETSKAYA SINCE IT IS\nNOT AN INTOURIST HOTEL.\n\n9.  AMBASSADOR STOESSL WILL CHAIR BRIEFING FOR SENATOR\nFOLLOWING HIS ARRIVAL SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9.  AMBASSADOR\nWOULD ALSO LIKE TO INVITE SENATOR AND PARTY TO BE HIS GUESTS\nAT EMBASSY MARINE BALL, WHICH STARTS AT 2000 NOVEMBER 9.\nNO OBLIGATION INVOLVED HERE, OF COURSE.\n\n10.
